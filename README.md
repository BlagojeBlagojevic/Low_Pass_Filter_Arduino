# Low_Pass_Filter_Arduino

The code in two folder implements a low-pass filter on an analog sensor reading. The low-pass filter is designed to smooth out high-frequency noise in the signal and pass low-frequency signals with minimal attenuation. The code takes a reading from an analog pin (A0), converts it to a voltage value, and applies the filter to the reading. The filtered signal is then printed to the serial monitor every 3 iterations, with a delay of 1ms in between each iteration.

In a Jupyter notebooks, the design of the low-pass filter could be explained and visualized by plotting the frequency response of the filter, showing the cutoff frequency and the amount of attenuation for high-frequency signals. ,  Filter coefficients, are calculete on a 2 diferent way.
